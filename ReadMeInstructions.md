Problems
    1. Trying to render data on the input value changes the inputs form controlled to uncontrolled. 
    2. on the preview component. It will display 1 component at a time if it's not or dinner. But not both. I know it has something to do with the if statements, but can't figure out what. 
    3. If I skip days to november 4. It crashes, even though there is data for servicetype lunch. There is not a dinner for that day, cause an underfined error. Trying to figure out how to just not show anything withough it crashing if there is no data on that day.
