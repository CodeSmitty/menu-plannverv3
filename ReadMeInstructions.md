Problems
    1. Trying to render data on the input value changes the inputs form controlled to uncontrolled. 
    
    2. Was able to get the preview to display based on data form firebase, but if I update I have to re type everything. Trying to figure out a way to keep the old data and only update the input that is changed. 

    3. Css is messed up, trying to render the form container and the previews container side by side and to split width in half.
